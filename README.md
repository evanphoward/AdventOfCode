# AdventOfCode

My solutions to Advent of Code programming puzzles found at adventofcode.com

First solutions were in early 2017 for the 2016 version and I've filled in the other puzzles in bits and pieces since then. After my initial commit in Nov. 2020 the commits should accurately reflect the order in which I did the puzzles.
